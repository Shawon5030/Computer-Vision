<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>The Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to create a simple color picker interface. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Importing Libraries:</strong> The script imports the required libraries, including OpenCV and Numpy.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Creating a Blank Image:</strong> A blank image is created using Numpy with white color.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Creating a Window:</strong> The script creates a window titled 'Color Picker' using OpenCV.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Trackbar and Callback Function:</strong> A trackbar named '0:Off/n1:On' is created for toggling color display. The script defines a callback function <code>nothing()</code> that does nothing.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Trackbars for Adjusting Color:</strong> Trackbars for adjusting the color (Red, Green, Blue) are created using OpenCV.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Displaying Image:</strong> The script continuously displays the image in the 'Color Picker' window using OpenCV.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Adjusting Color:</strong> Users can adjust the color using the trackbars. When the '0:Off/n1:On' trackbar is toggled ON, the color of the image is set based on the trackbar positions.</li>
</ol>

<p>This color picker interface provides a simple way to interactively adjust colors and visualize their effects.</p>
